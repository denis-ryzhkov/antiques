========

This repository contains just a *tiniest* top of the iceberg of code I have created since 1992.

Every project in this repository meets the next assertions:
* It is **old frozen** project, I'm not supporting any more. Supported projects have their own repositories.
* It is **not a commercial** secret, while most code I have created - is.
* It is more or less **finished** and may have some interest or even value to you (especially `libs/python`).
Most other projects not included in this repository are labs and unfinished drafts, sometimes big enough.
Few unpublished here drafts still have a chance of being returned to later.
* It is of some **nostalgia** for me. Strange feeling.
* It is **not lost**. And lost there is a plenty of code. Some pieces I'm missing very much are:
    * *Delta* IDE to create game pieces: graphics, sprites, and sounds.
    Created with MSX Basic at Yamaha multimedia computer. It won 1-st place at Belarus republic-level competition in 1996.
    * My *first code*, drawing my pet turtle by looping through the array of coordinates.
    ZX Basic and ASM at 1992's ZX Spectrum with tape recorder instead of disk.
